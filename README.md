In vanilla, leaves will not decay as long as they're attached to either a logblock or any instance of leavesblock, this mod changes it so that leaves will decay if they are attached to a leaf or log that does not match the tree they came from.

Can run serverside only but still works in singleplayer.

Requires Fabric loader
